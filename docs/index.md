## Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

I want to use the time while we're unable to meet in person to develop skills that might be hard to learn in a traditional classroom. So we'll focus on three [essential standards][es] (click on the link for more details about the individual standards):
* remote collaboration,
* self-directed learning, and
* assessing your work.

These turn out to be skills that are highly valued by employers and ones that you are likely to use professionally if you pursue a career as a computer or networking technician.

Both the TestOut PCPro and the CompTIA A+ exams can be taken online. CompTIA is working on a plan for taking the A+ exams without having to go to a testing center.

## Demonstrating Self-directed Learning

### Study Journal

If you have regular and reliable Internet access, I'd like you to keep an online study journal as you work on getting ready for the PCPro and CompTIA certification tests. Please see the [Study Journal][sj] assignment for more information. If you don't have Internet access, please set up a meeting with me during [office hours][oh] so that we can work out an alternative.

### Study & Practice in TestOut

With Internet access, you can continue work in TestOut. If you do not have Internet access please set up time to meet with me to develop a plan. One option would be to have the TestOut Fact Sheets mailed to you.

As an indicator that you're continuing your work, I'll be looking at the usage information that TestOut logs. For each chapter I expect to see:
* That you have watched (and made notes from) all of the videos in the chapter.
* That you have spent time reviewing the Fact Sheets & slides.
* That you have attempted the labs & practice tests.

We have about 50 days left in the school year. Working only on weekdays a rough schedule would 7 days for each of the remaining 7 chapters (8-14).

## Asynchronous Collaboration

After we get an idea of how many people are attending class we'll set up study groups. These will be asynchrous â€“ each member will have a role and the groups will not have to meet together (although you could).

You may find it helpful to get notifications from Canvas. To do this you will need to add a working e-mail adderess (the SKSD Google accounts we use for authentication don't have valid e-mail associated with them) or number for SMS (text) messages. To do this:
1. Sign in to Canvas.
1. Click on the **Account** button on the left-hand sidebar.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Under **Ways to Contact**, you'll find **Email Addresses** and **Other Contacts**. Below those either the **+ Email Address** or the **+ Contact Method** links will take you to a dialog that will let you add an e-mail adderess and/or a cell number for notifications.
1. If you find that you'd like to adjust the type or frequency of notifications that you get you can do that under the **Notifications** item in your account.
