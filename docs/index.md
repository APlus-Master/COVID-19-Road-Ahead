## Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

I want to use the time while we're unable to meet in person to develop skills that might be hard to learn in a traditional classroom. So we'll focus on three [essential standards][es] (click on the link for more details about the individual standards):
* remote collaboration,
* self-directed learning, and
* assessing your work.

These turn out to be skills that are highly valued by employers and ones that you are likely to use professionally if you pursue a career as a computer or networking technician.

## Demonstrating Your Learning

If you have regular and reliable Internet access, I'd like you to keep an online study journal as you work on getting ready for the PCPro and CompTIA certification tests. Please see the [Study Journal][sj] assignment for more information. If you don't have Internet access, please set up a meeting with me during [office hours][oh] so that we can work out an alternative.
